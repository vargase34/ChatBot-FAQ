# ChatBot-FAQ

A simple excercise to learn more about Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. Machine learning is the ability for the machine to learn. In this case, my chatbot was created using QnAMaker on Azure. ML is used here because training data was used to teach the machine on how to respond using a confidence score. If I write the same question as the one I created in the ChatBot but just worded differently, the ChatBot will find the best answer that connects.
